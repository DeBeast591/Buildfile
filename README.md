# Buildfile
A simple building file for simple needs.

# Features
- Building with G++
- Quite a few git commands (pull, push, add, commit, etc.)

# Usage
Usage is pretty simple. Download the `buildfile_src/main.py` file, you can rename it if you'd like, then you make a `Buildfile` file, then finally, run `python3 path/to/main.py path/to/Buildfile`!

# Credits
none of these (yet)
